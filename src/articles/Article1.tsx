      <h1> on the question of these chinese-peruvian dogs:</h1>
      <p>
        On December 26, 1980, residents of Ayacucho, Peru woke up to find dead
        dogs strung up and hung from lamp posts. Their corpses were wrapped with
        signs that read “Deng Xiaoping son of a bitch”{" "}
        <i>(Teng Hsiao-Ping hijo de perra)</i>, and rumors began to circulate
        that explosives were hidden among the dogs. Members of the Shining Path{" "}
        <i>(Sendero Luminoso)</i>, a militant Peruvian Maoist organization, hung
        the dogs in Ayacucho as well as in Lima on the birthday of Mao Zedong
      </p>
