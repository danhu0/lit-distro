            In 1928, José Carlos Mariátegui wrote a book. The book was titled
            simply: <i>Seven Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality.</i>{" "}
            Mariáteguistas have puzzled over Peruvian reality ever since.

            In either 1968 or 1969, Abimael Guzmán, chairman of the Shining
            Path, gave a lecture at the Universidad Nacional de San Cristóbal de
            Huamanga in Ayachucho. The lecture was titled simply:{" "}
            <i>To Understand Mariátegui</i>.
          </p>
          <p>Guzmán says:</p>
          <p>
            “There is not in all of Latin America another Marxist-Leninist
            comparable to him in any way; truly José Carlos Mariátegui is a
            summit of Latin-American Marxism thought and a greater summit as
            time goes on.”

            In 2016, shane (mariáte)greene, punk anthropologist, wrote a book
            published by Duke University Press. The book was titled simply:{" "}
            <i>
              punk and revolution: 7 more interpretations of peruvian reality
            </i>
            .
          </p>
          <p>(mariáte)greene says:</p>
          <p>"Thanks go to the ghost of Mariátegui for putting up with me."</p>
          <p>
            I want to take this space to think about ghosts. Here, I want to
            think about inheritance of the intellect. Think: Mariátegui.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will try to write plainly. This will be a project cloaked in so
            many abstractions, so I will not seek to add to the complexity with
            the style of my language. I will respect the simple sentence. By
            that I mean that each sentence will be written with care and without
            undue ornamentation.

        <div style={{ paddingLeft: 50, flex: 1 }}>
          <p>
            I will respect the page. By that I mean that the words that I write
            and the images that I present will never exceed the width and height
            of the one single screen. I want you to see the whole universe of
            this text all at once.
          </p>

            Let it be said that this project will attempt to take seriously the
            Sendero Luminoso, known in English as the Shining Path. I will not
            valorize them, but I am not willing to dismiss them as simple
            fanatics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let it be acknowledged that this is a project of the petit bourgeois
            intellectual. By that, I am referencing what Guzmán has to say about
            technology:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Scientific and technological developments are products of the
            transformative action of the proletariat and the people. But the
            financial oligarchy, the grand bourgeois, imperialism appropriate
            them. They are their private property, of the monopolies and
            instruments of exploitation. In the shadow of this has developed a
            layer of scum of technocrats, who craftily try, making noises aimed
            at the working class, and especially at petit bourgeois
            intellectuals, to substitute a false revolution, with a different
            path, without the class struggle. However, only with real revolution
            can science and technology fulfill their potential. Because only
            with revolution will their full productivity be realized, and their
            benefits reach the workers and the poor."
          </p>
          <p>
            This project will have all the markings of my positionality. This
            project is a product of technology. This project will be entirely
            open source. This project will use its status of being open source
            to participate in a larger project of wresting the locus of
            technological power away from "the finanical oligarchy, the grand
            bourgeois, imperialism." This project will talk about revolution.
            Finally, this project will interpret Peruvian reality, if only the
            thinnest slice of it, seen through the tiniest pinhole.
